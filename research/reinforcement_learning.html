  <h2>Deep Reinforcement Learning in Natural Language State Space</h2>
  Recently, I have taken a strong interest and appreciation for decision process, control and prediction for goal-orientated agent based modeling. Hence, I have recently been considering where NLP problems can be viewed as agents navigating a language state space. Commonly, dialogue systems usually have a goal of coming to some significant resolve which can be viewed as a goal, likewise in Question-Answering system the goal is to produce the correct, or most contextually correct answer to the user.
