Structured Prediction
---------------------

Strucutred prediction (SP) is a concept underlying many fundamental aspects of machine learning as many problems, particularly in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, 
are inherently hierarchical or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
Therefore, the purpose of this post is to introduce the main ideas behind structured prediction and how many popular ML algorithms are augmented to deal with structured problems.
Since deep learning (DL) is all the rage currently, and many of you folk will be reading with the main incentive being strucutered predictions relevance, we waste no time introducing SP for Neural Nets.
